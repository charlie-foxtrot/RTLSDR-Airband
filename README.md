# RTLSDR-Airband

![main](https://github.com/charlie-foxtrot/RTLSDR-Airband/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

**NOTE: Going forward a release tag will be automatically created on each merge to `main`.  For the latest version, see [here](https://github.com/charlie-foxtrot/RTLSDR-Airband/releases/latest).**

**NOTE: Going forward PRs will be opened directly against `main` and the `unstable` branch will no longer be used.**

**NOTE: This repo has significantly diverged from the original project [microtony/RTLSDR-Airband](https://github.com/microtony/RTLSDR-Airband) so it has been been detached (ie no longer a fork).**

**NOTE: As of version `v5.0.0` specific build support for `rpiv1`, `armv7-generic`, and `armv8-generic` have been deprecated for the new default `native`, see [#447](https://github.com/charlie-foxtrot/RTLSDR-Airband/discussions/447)**

**NOTE: Repo URL has moved to https://github.com/charlie-foxtrot/RTLSDR-Airband see [#342](https://github.com/charlie-foxtrot/RTLSDR-Airband/discussions/342) for info**


RTLSDR-Airband receives analog radio voice channels and produces
audio streams which can be routed to various outputs, such as online
streaming services like LiveATC.net. Originally the only SDR type
supported by the program was Realtek DVB-T dongle (hence the project's
name). However, thanks to SoapySDR vendor-neutral SDR library, other
radios are now supported as well.
