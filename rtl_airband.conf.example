# Sample RTLSDR_Airband configuration file with a brief syntax explanation
# 
# General libconfig format description can be found in libconfig manual
# (http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html)

# Each parameter is specified as:
# 
#   key = value;
# 
# Remember about the semicolon at the end.
# 
# Keys can be scalars:
# 
#   myinteger = 5;
#   myfloat = -3.5;
#   mystring = "This is a string";
# 
# or lists (ordered):
# 
#   mylist = (5, 8, 3, "string");
# 
# Parameters can be grouped, like so:
# 
#   mygroup = {
#     param1 = 3;
#     param2 = -5;
#     param3 = "some text";
#   };
# 
# Parameter names inside the group must be unique.
# Lists and groups can contain scalars as well as groups or lists.
#
# Three types of comments are allowed within a configuration:
#
# - Script-style comments (beginning with a '#' character)
# - C-style comments, /* like so */
# - C++-style comments (beginning with // sequence)

# global parameters

# log messages via syslog? Default: 0 (no)
