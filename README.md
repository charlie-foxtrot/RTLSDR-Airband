RTLSDR-Airband
=====================

RTLSDR Airband is intended for Airband reception and online streaming to services such as liveatc.net

Features
---------------------
 * Multichannel mode - decode up to eight AM channels per dongle (within bandwidth frequency range)
 * Scanner mode - decode unlimited number of AM channels with frequency hopping in a round-robin
   fashion (no frequency range limitations)
 * Decode multiple dongles simutaneously
 * Auto squelch and Automatic Gain Control
 * MP3 encoding
 * Stream to Icecast or SHOUTcast server
 * Record to local MP3 files (continuously or skipping silence periods)
 * Multiple streaming/recording destinations per channel

Performance
---------------------
### x86
 * ~4% per dongle on i5-2430m at 2.1 GHz

### Raspberry Pi
 * FFT using Broadcom Videocore IV GPU
 * No overclock required when using 1 dongle plus another dongle running dump1090
 * Turbo overclock setting recommended on RPi V1 when using 2 dongles
   (no overclocking is necessary on RPi V2)

### Other ARMv7-based platforms
 * FFT using main CPU
 * Tested on Cubieboard2 - ~50% CPU when using 1 dongle

### Linux (Raspbian)
 * Install RTLSDR library (http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr):

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install git gcc autoconf make libusb-1.0-0-dev libtool
        cd
        git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git
        cd rtl-sdr/
        autoreconf -i
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo ldconfig
        sudo mv $HOME/rtl-sdr/rtl-sdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/rtl-sdr.rules

 * Blacklist DVB drivers to avoid conflict with SDR driver - before connecting
   the USB dongle create file `/etc/modprobe.d/dvb-blacklist.conf` with text
   editor (eg. nano) and add the following lines:

        blacklist r820t
        blacklist rtl2832
        blacklist rtl2830
        blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu

 * Download a release tarball from from https://github.com/szpajder/RTLSDR-Airband/releases
   and unpack it. Example:

        tar xvfz RTLSDR-Airband-1.0.0.tar.gz
        cd RTLSDR-Airband-1.0.0

   Alternatively you can pull the latest code from git (but please be aware that it might
   be experimental, buggy, or at least, untested):

        git clone https://github.com/szpajder/RTLSDR-Airband.git
        cd RTLSDR-Airband/

 * Install necessary dependencies:

        sudo apt-get install libmp3lame-dev libvorbis-dev libshout-dev libconfig++-dev

 * Set the PLATFORM environment variable (to indicate your hardware platform) and run `make`.
   For example, to build a binary for RPi version 1 (ARMv6 CPU, Broadcom VideoCore GPU) type
   the following:

        PLATFORM=rpiv1 make

   Building for RPi V2 (ARMv7 CPU, Broadcom VideoCore GPU):

        PLATFORM=rpiv2 make

   Building for other ARMv7-based platforms without VideoCore GPU, eg. Cubieboard (FFTW3
   library is needed in this case):

        sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
        PLATFORM=armv7-generic make

   Building for generic x86 CPU (FFTW3 library is needed in this case):

        sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
        PLATFORM=x86 make

 * Install the software:

        make install

   By default, the binary is installed to `/usr/local/bin/rtl_airband`.

 * Edit the configuration file to suit your needs. See chapter "Configuring" below.

 * You need to run the program with root privileges - for example:

        sudo /usr/local/bin/rtl_airband

   The program runs as a daemon (background process) by default, so it may look like
   it has exited right after startup. Diagnostic messages are printed to syslog
   (on Raspbian they are directed to `/var/log/messages` by default).

 * If you wish to start the program automatically at boot, you can use example startup
   scripts from `init.d` subdirectory. Example for Debian / Raspbian:

        sudo cp init.d/rtl_airband-debian.sh /etc/init.d/rtl_airband
        sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/rtl_airband
        sudo update-rc.d rtl_airband defaults

Configuring
--------------------
By default, the configuration is read from `/usr/local/etc/rtl_airband.conf`.
Refer to `rtl_airband.conf.example` for the description of the format. You can
copy this file to `/usr/local/etc/rtl_airband.conf` and edit it to suit your needs
(`make install` does this, unless you already have your own config file installed).

Old versions of RTLSDR-Airband used a simple flat `config.txt` file. This is no longer
supported. You have to rewrite your config file to the new syntax - or just use a
small utility `convert_cfg` which is included in the `util` subdirectory:

    cd util
    make
    ./convert_cfg /path/to/old/config.txt /path/to/new/rtl_airband.conf

Review the `rtl_airband.conf` file and move it to `/usr/local/etc` before launching
rtl_airband:

    sudo mv /path/to/new/rtl_airband.conf /usr/local/etc

Command line options
--------------------
rtl_airband accepts the following command line options:

    -h                      Display this help text
    -f                      Run in foreground, display textual waterfalls
    -c <config_file_path>   Use non-default configuration file

Troubleshooting
--------------------

Syslog logging is enabled by default, so first of all, check the logs for
any error messages, for example: `tail /var/log/messages`. Common problems:

*  Problem 1: the program fails to start on RPi. It dumps the error message:

    Dec 27 08:58:00 mypi rtl_airband[28876]: Can't open device file /dev/vcio: No such file or directory

   Solution: you need to create `/dev/vcio` device node. To do that, you need to
   know the correct major number. Older Raspbian kernels (before 4.0) used 100,
   newer ones use 249, so first check that:

    pi@mypi:~$ grep vcio /proc/devices
    249 vcio

   This means `/dev/vcio` must be created with a major number of 249:

    sudo mknod /dev/vcio c 249 0

   In other case, substitute 249 with the number taken from `grep` output above.

*  Problem 2: the program fails to start on RPi. It dumps the error message:

    Dec 27 08:58:00 mypi rtl_airband[28876]: Can't open device file /dev/vcio: No such device or address

   or:

    Dec 27 08:58:00 mypi rtl_airband[28876]: mbox_property(): ioctl_set_msg failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device

   This means you have `/dev/vcio`, but its major number is probably wrong:

    pi@mypi:~$ ls -l /dev/vcio
    crw-rw---T 1 root video 100, 0 Jan  1  1970 /dev/vcio

   This one was created with a major number of 100. `grep vcio /proc/devices`
   shows the correct number - if it's different, then delete it (`sudo rm /dev/vcio`)
   and create it again (see above).

*  Problem 3: the program fails to start on RPi. It dumps the error message:

    Unable to enable V3D. Please check your firmware is up to date.

   Most often this is a problem of people who changed the default CPU:GPU memory split
   by setting `gpu_mem` to something lower than 64 MB. Check your `/boot/config.txt`
   and remove the `gpu_mem` setting altogether, if it's there. Then save the file
   and reboot the Pi.

 * When the program is running in scan mode and is interrupted by a signal
   (eg. ctrl+C is pressed when run in foreground mode) it crashes with segmentation
   fault or spits out error messages similar to these:

    r82xx_write: i2c wr failed=-1 reg=1a len=1
    r82xx_set_freq: failed=-1
    rtlsdr_demod_write_reg failed with -1
    rtlsdr_demod_read_reg failed with -7

   This is due to a bug in libusb versions earlier than 1.0.17. Upgrade to a newer
   version.
