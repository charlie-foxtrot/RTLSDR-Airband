 Theory of operation:

 Squelch has 5 states, OPEN (has audio), CLOSED (no audio), OPENING (transitioning from CLOSED to OPEN),
 CLOSING (transitioning from OPEN to CLOSED), and LOW_SIGNAL_ABORT (same as CLOSING but because of a constant
 signal drop).

 Squelch is considered "open" when the state is OPEN or CLOSING and squelch is considered "closed" when the
 state is OPENING, LOW_SIGNAL_ABORT, or CLOSED.

 Noise floor is computed using a low pass filter and updated with the current sample or prior value, whatever
 is lower.  Noise floor is updated every 16 stamples, except when squelch is open.

 Low pass filters are also used to track the current signal levels.  One level is for the sample before
 filtering, the second for post signal filtering (if any).  The pre-filter signal level is updated for every
 sample.  The post-filter level is optional.  When used, the post-filter signal level is compared to a
 delayed pre-filter value.  The post-filter is set to a fraction of the pre-filtered value each time state
 transitions to OPENING, and is not updated while state is CLOSED.

 Squelch level can be set manually or is computed as a function of the noise floor.

 When the signal level exceeds the squelch level, the state transitions to OPENING and a delay counter starts,
 then once the counter is over the state moves to OPEN if there is signal, otherwise back to CLOSED. The same
 (but opposite) happens when the signal level drops below the squelch level.

 While the squelch is OPEN, a count of continuous samples that are below the squelch level is maintained.  If
 this count exceeds a threshold then the state moves to LOW_SIGNAL_ABORT.  This allows the squelch to close
 after a sharp drop off in signal before the signal level has caught up.

 A count of "recent opens" is maintained as a way to detect squelch flapping (ie rapidly opening and closing).
 When flapping is detected the squelch level is decreased in an attempt to keep squelch open longer.
